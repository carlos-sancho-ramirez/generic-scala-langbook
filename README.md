# generic-scala-langbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/carlos-sancho-ramirez/generic-scala-langbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carlos-sancho-ramirez/generic-scala-langbook)

Langbook is intended to be a tool to help people in their task of learning new
languages and master the ones they may already know. A database is used to store
words for the different languages and link them with concepts in a sensible way
that may bring basic semantic.

This repository contains all sources that are platform independent.

See also [android-scala-langbook](https://github.com/carlos-sancho-ramirez/android-scala-langbook) for the Android app
using this code as library.
